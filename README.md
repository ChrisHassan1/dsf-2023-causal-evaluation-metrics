## Causal Evaluation Metrics

This repo gives template code for carrying out causal evaluation metrics.

We recommend the following excellent book to understand these concepts better [Causal Inference for The Brave and True](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html). The datasets used in this notebook were taken from this [chapter](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/21-Meta-Learners.html)
